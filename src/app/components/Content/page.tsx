<p className="p-5">
I have a solid grasp of HTML, the backbone of web content, and CSS, the styling language that turns ideas into beautiful designs. I excel at building responsive, accessible, and well-structured websites that shine on any device. Using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid, I ensure my layouts are both flexible and visually compelling.</p>

<p className="p-5">
To enhance my coding skills, I've embraced TypeScript, a powerful language that adds static types to JavaScript. TypeScript helps me write more predictable and maintainable code, leading to robust applications that stand up to real-world use.
